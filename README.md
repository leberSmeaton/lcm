### **R7:** What problem does Lockdown Creatives Markplace solve? <!--Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app. -->

The Lockdown Creatives Marketplace (LCM) app provides a platform for artists and creatives to gain income during locked and a centralised location to purchase artistic goods and services to support the artists we love. </br>

When COVID-19 entered our lives LCM found two major problems that needed solving;

- Our incredible creative industry was locked down and unable to make an income. _How can artists make an income when the arts and entertainment sectors are closed?_ </br>
  Many artists and creatives don't have an online shop to sell themselves or their products, and that's where LCM comes in.
- "We were bored, locked down in our homes and often lacking a creative outlet, all out of ideas or just looking to have some fun."</br> _What are new and fun ways to entertain ourselves in a creative way during lockdown?_ </br> **AND** </br> _How can we best support our arts and entertainment industry?_ </br>
  Many users looking to buy creative kits or artistic experiences don't know where to look as large scale marketplaces don't cater for spatial or conceptual entertainment or art.

### **R8:** Why is it a problem that needs solving? <!-- Why is it a problem that needs solving? -->

Whilst larger marketplaces exist they are incredibly broad and not artist centric or built to aid creative entertainment.

We need to provide income opportunities to those who've lost their jobs during the pandemic. By creating a platform that can future-proof by getting artists thinking of their craft 'out-side-the-box', 'outside-of-the-gallery', 'out-side-of-the-theatre', may help them generate a new income field.

The categories are built around interactivity and experiences rather than products and static items. Such as online 'Trivia' hosted by local comedians, and 'Pottery' kits created and guided by Melbourne ceramicists.
